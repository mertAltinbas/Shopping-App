# Shopping-App

I want to introduce you to my ShoppingApp application that I made using FakeAPI. The main transitions in my application proceed in the form of bottom navigation.In my application a basket, favorites and a categories sections. When my application is opened for the first time, page switching is performed in the form of a slider using pagerstate. You can click on my github link to follow these and similar projects of mine. Have a nice day.
